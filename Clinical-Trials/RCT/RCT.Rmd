## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The data is from Jama Cardiology on Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplement Use With Cardiovascular Disease Risks Meta-analysis of 10 Trials Involving 77917 Individuals

```{r metafor}
library(tidyverse)

Control.per=c(12.5,10.1,16.9,3.5,13.6,28.6, 11.9,23.9,20.7,27.3)
rct<-data.frame(Year,Trials,Treatment,Treatment.per,Control,Control.per) %>%
  mutate(Treatment.number=round(Treatment*100/Treatment.per,0),
         Control.number=round(Control*100/Control.per,0)) %>%
  rename(ai=Treatment,n1i=Treatment.number,ci=Control,
         n2i=Control.number,study=Trials,year=Year)

#peto's fixed effect method
res <- rma.peto(ai=ai, n1i=n1i, ci=ci, n2i=n2i, data=rct)
print(res, digits=2)

result<-predict(res, transf=exp, digits=2)
#forest plot
forest(res, targs=list(study=rct$study), 
main="RCT of Omega3 fatty acid for cardiovascular disease")
# funnel plot 
funnel(res, refline=0, level=c(90, 95, 99), shade=c("white", "gray", "darkgray"))

```

```{r random effect}
dat <- escalc(measure = "OR",ai=ai, n1i=n1i, ci=ci, n2i=n2i,data=rct)
res.DL<-rma(yi,vi, method = "DL",data=dat)
forest(res.DL,main="RCT of Omega3 fatty acid for cardiovascular disease")
```
```{r baujat}
# adjust margins so the space is better used
par(mar=c(5,4,2,2))
# create Baujat plot to explore source of heterogeneity
baujat(res.DL, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,0.2))
```
```{r gosh}
### fit FE model to all possible subsets
sav <- gosh(res.DL)
 
### create GOSH plot
### red points for subsets that include and blue points
### for subsets that exclude study 16 (the ISIS-4 trial)
plot(sav, out=dim(rct)[1], breaks=100)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
