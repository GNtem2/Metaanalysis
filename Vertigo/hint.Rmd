## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


This is a practice run. The data needs to have columns TP, FP, FN, TN. The data comes from study Acad Emerg Med. 2020 Mar 13. doi: 10.1111/acem.13960. It contains findings performed by different types of specialists

```{r data}
library(tidyverse)
library(mada)

#old data
#dat<-readxl::read_xlsx("Vertigo_data_SO.xlsx")

#new data
#subset data for analysis
dat<-read.csv("vertigo160720.csv") %>% 
  select (Authors, PubYear, TP, FP, FN, TN) %>% 
  #remove row 4 with no data
  slice(-4)




#positive likelihood
posLR.DSL <- madauni(dat, type = "posLR", method = "DSL")
summary(posLR.DSL)
forest(posLR.DSL)

#negative likelihood
negLR.DSL <- madauni(dat, type = "negLR", method = "DSL")
summary(negLR.DSL)
forest(negLR.DSL)
```
```{r bivariate}
##bivariate analysis

(ss<-reitsma(dat))
summary(ss)
AUC(reitsma(data = dat))
sumss<-SummaryPts(ss,n.iter = 10^3) #bivariate pooled LR
summary(sumss)

plot(ss, xlim = c(0,.5), ylim = c(.5,1)) 
 #    main = "Comparison of Retrospective and Prospective studies") 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
